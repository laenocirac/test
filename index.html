<h3>Day 1 - December 21st, 2017</h3>
<p>So,the first entry. I don't really know why I'm doing this. I know that
 something in my life is not right and I need to fix it. <br /> I don't
plan on tweeting out this link, posting it on Facebook, or even sharing it
among friends. This is for me. Maybe I'll make sure to somehow share it once
I'm gone, but I hope I have time to figure out how to do that. As I write this,
I have yet to even figure out how to host this site for free. So, first step is that
I guess. </p>
